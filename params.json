But, yes, but, you may only want to have a glance at the page, and you don't want to open it at a new tab or windows, or sometimes horribly replace the current page (Oh shit!).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo here comes the Preview It (名字待定).\r\n\r\n### Hover on the link you want to preview\r\nDon't know what is hover? hover is putting your cursor onto the link, that means the cursor in within the link range.\r\n\r\n### Press the \"w\" button on your keyboard.\r\nDon't have a keyboard? Oh, we will find some more fancy way to activate the function, after all it's in beta phase.\r\nUsing the phone? Sorry, you are not able to use any kinds of extension.\r\n\r\n### interact with the preview box\r\nYes, you can simply scroll, click the links or even fill the forms in the preview box. You just need to regard it as a small window, just looks cute and not takes too much spaces.\r\n\r\n### When you don't want it anymore, just press \"w\" key again.\r\nJust like nothing happened, no changes to your current page.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
